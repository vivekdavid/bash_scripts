# Bash Scripts 

This is meant to be a growing list of bash scripts that I find useful. 

## Blog gitter 
- requires - w3m 

This script gets all blog posts on a site with consecutively numbered blogs and converts them into txt files for later offline reading. Just change the url to the first part of your blogs url and the 1..277 number to the number of blog posts you wish to get.

Enjoy!
